# College Student Stress Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains code and data associated with the research paper "Optimizing Well-Being: Unveiling Eustress and Distress through Machine Learning" by Ashutosh Singh, Khushdeep Singh, Amit Kumar, Abhishek Shrivastava, and Santosh Kumar from the Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, International Institute of Information Technology Naya Raipur, India.

## Abstract
The research addresses rising stress levels among college students by implementing various machine learning algorithms to predict and mitigate both Eustress and Distress. The study utilized a questionnaire dataset validated by experts to comprehensively understand stress across multiple dimensions. Key findings include K-Nearest Neighbors achieving 93% accuracy for Eustress prediction and Logistic Regression achieving 99% accuracy for Distress prediction.

## Methodology
The methodology involves data preparation, preprocessing, feature selection, model creation, training/testing, classification, and result analysis. Various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and K-nearest Neighbors were employed to classify Eustress and Distress.


## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this study was collected through a workshop aimed at analyzing stress levels among college students, with the assistance of experts. Participating college students aged 18-21 were randomly given questionnaires related to stress. Real-time data was collected using a Google Form.

The resulting dataset is organized in CSV format and comprises 28 attributes for statistical analysis of stress levels. These attributes correspond to a series of questions posed to college students, addressing their experiences and feelings concerning stress over the past two months. The questions are categorized into seven distinct groups: Stress and Emotional Well-being, Physical Well-being, Academic Performance, Relationships and Social Environment, Leisure and Relaxation, and their Eustress and Distress levels.

Respondents were asked to provide necessary personal details. The questions offered five response options ranging from "Not at all" to "Extremely". These categories have been utilized to label and organize the collected data, providing a comprehensive view of the students' stress-related experiences across these different dimensions.
